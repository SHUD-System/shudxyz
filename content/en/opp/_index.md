## The institute

The Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIEER, CAS [www.nieer.cas.cn](http://www.nieer.cas.cn))is a multidisciplinary research institute, specializing in study of eco-environment, natural resources, and national key environmental engineering; focusing on, among other things, cryosphere and global climate change, frozen ground and cold regions engineering, desert and desertification, plateau atmospheric physics and meteorology, water and land resources and environmental rehabilitation, ecology and agriculture, remote sensing information system, oil and gas geology, plateau biology, salt lake resources, and scientific information service.

The NIEER comprises three research units, and they are experimental and analytical unit, field observation unit, and information platform and networking unit. These facilities provide excellent conditions for scientific research and observation.

The experimental and analytical unit is home to 2 state key laboratories, namely State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soils Engineering and State Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Sciences, 6 CAS key laboratories, 20 provincial key labs/engineering or R&D centers.

The field observation unit comprises twenty-five field stations, among them six are graded as national key station, three as CAS key station, and sixteen as institute key station. These field stations play an important role in supporting field work, long-term monitoring, data accumulation and graduate student training.


## The laboratory
Key Laboratory of Land Surface Process and Climate Change in Cold and Arid Regions, Chinese Academy of Sciences([http://lpcc.careeri.cas.cn](http://lpcc.careeri.cas.cn)), major research covers climate dynamics, climate change, land-surface process, hydrology and deept learning.


## The PI

Dr. Shu is an associate professor at Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in Water Resource Engineering and a minor degree of Computational Science from Pennsylvania State University in 2017. He is the lead developer of the Simulator for Hydrologic Unstructured Domains(SHUD, [www.shud.xyz](www.shud.xyz)) model. His research interests are computational hydrologic model, hydrologic data mining, and integrated Coupled Nature-Human System modeling.

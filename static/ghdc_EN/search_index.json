The users provide the watershed boundary, GHDC will do the data retrieve, subset clipping, reprojection, spatial-temporal data pre-processing, and so forth. Then, the user will receive a download link for the watershed. GHDC user guide link: Chinese version: https://shud.xyz/ghdc_CN/ English version: https://shud.xyz/ghdc_EN/ License We do not produce data, but process data for modelers. So the license and right belong to original data creators. The current datasets support Public Domain, that allows reprocess and redistribute the data.

abstract = {Abstract. Understanding the intricate hydrological interactions between lakes and their surrounding watersheds is pivotal for advancing hydrological research, optimizing water resource management, and informing climate change mitigation strategies. Yet, these complex dynamics are often insufficiently captured in existing hydrological models, such as the bi-direction surface and subsurface flow. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel lake–watershed coupled model, an enhancement of the Simulator of Hydrological Unstructured Domains. This high-resolution, distributed model employs unstructured triangles as its fundamental hydrological computing units (HCUs), offering a physical approach to hydrological modeling. We validated our model using data from Qinghai Lake in China, spanning from 1979 to 2018. Remarkably, the model not only successfully simulated the streamflow of the Buha River, a key river within the Qinghai Lake basin, achieving a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.62 and 0.76 for daily and monthly streamflow, respectively, but also accurately reproduced the decrease–increase U-shaped curve of lake level change over the past 40 years, with an NSE of 0.71. Our model uniquely distinguishes the contributions of various components to the lake's long-term water balance, including river runoff, surface direct runoff, lateral groundwater contribution, direct evaporation, and precipitation. This work underscores the potential of our coupled model as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting hydrological processes in lake basins, thereby contributing to more effective water resource management and climate change mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Hydrological modeling, leveraging mathematical formulations to represent the hydrological cycle, is a pivotal tool in representing the spatiotemporal dynamics and distribution patterns inherent in hydrology. These models serve a dual purpose: they validate theoretical robustness and applicability via observational data and project future trends, thereby bridging the understanding and prediction of natural processes. In rapid advancements in computational methodologies and the continuous evolution of observational and experimental techniques, the development of numerical hydrological models based on physically-based surface-subsurface process coupling have accelerated. Anchored in micro-scale conservation principles and physical equations, these models employ numerical techniques to integrate surface and subsurface hydrodynamics, thus replicating the macro-scale hydrological responses of watersheds. Numerical hydrological models have emerged as a leading and predominant trend in hydrological modeling due to their explicit representation of physical processes, heightened by their spatiotemporal resolution and reliance on interdisciplinary integration. This article focuses on the theoretical foundation of surface-subsurface numerical hydrological models. It includes a comparative and analytical discussion of leading numerical hydrological models, encompassing model architecture, numerical solution strategies, spatial representation, and coupling algorithms. Additionally, this paper contrasts these models with traditional hydrological models, thereby delineating the relative merits, drawbacks, and future directions of numerical hydrological modeling.},

However, achieving reproducibility and automation in distributed hydrological modeling research for modeling, simulation, and analysis is challenging. This paper introduces rSHUD v2.0, an innovative, open-source toolkit developed in the R environment to enhance the deployment and analysis of the Simulator for Hydrologic Unstructured Domains (SHUD). The SHUD is an integrated surface–subsurface hydrological model that employs a finite-volume method to simulate hydrological processes at various scales. The rSHUD toolkit includes pre- and post-processing tools, facilitating reproducibility and automation in hydrological modeling. The utility of rSHUD is demonstrated through case studies of the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in the USA and the Waerma watershed in China. The rSHUD toolkit's ability to quickly and automatically deploy models while ensuring reproducibility has facilitated the implementation of the Global Hydrological Data Cloud (https://ghdc.ac.cn, last access: 1 September 2023), a platform for automatic data processing and model deployment.

abstract = {Qinghai Lake is the largest lake in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and China, it is also an important part of the national ecological security strategy. Since 1950s, the water level of Qinghai Lake has been changing rapidly, which induces great effects on the surrounding traffic facilities, residents' safety and the development of animal husbandry, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to study the water level evolution and water balance of Qinghai Lake under the main impact of climate change. Based on meteorological and hydrological data from Buha River Hydrological Station, Xiashe Hydrological Station, and Gangcha Meteorological Station, CMFD, and water balance equation, this article first analyzes the interannual and intra-year water level evolution characteristics of Qinghai Lake from 1956 to 2020, including lake surface precipitation (P), runoff into the lake (Rs) and evaporation (E). Secondly, we conducted a study on the water level change characteristics calculated for fixed months. Finally, the contribution rate of each factor to the fluctuation of Qinghai Lake water level was quantitatively calculated using the ridge regression method. Results show that the annual average water level declined at a rate of 0.8 m decade−1 from 1956 to 2004, primarily due to E exceeding the sum of P and Rs. However, from 2004 to 2020, the water level increased at a rate of 1.7 m decade−1, mainly attributed to the increase in P and Rs. Qinghai Lake exhibits evident intra-year variations, with the water level starting to rise in May and reaching its peak in September, which aligns with the monthly variations of Rs, P, and E. Furthermore, the impacts of the current year's P, Rs, and E on the annual water level fluctuations for fixed months of September to December is greater than that of the previous year. Specifically, the contributions of the current year's P, Rs and E to the water level fluctuations calculated based on December data are 10%, 70%, and 20%, respectively. The contribution rate of meteorological factors to the rise and fall of water level was wind speed (33%), downward short-wave radiation (27%), precipitation (27%), downward long-wave radiation (11%) and specific humidity (2%).},

abstract = {Thousands of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a critical role in the regional water cycle, weather, and climate. In recent years, the areas of TP lakes underwent drastic changes and have become a research hotspot. However, the characteristics of the lake-atmosphere interaction over the high-altitude lakes are still unclear, which inhibits model development and the accurate simulation of lake climate effects. The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) has the largest outflow lake and freshwater lake on the TP and is one of the most densely distributed lakes on the TP. Since 2011, three observation sites have been set up in the Ngoring Lake basin in the SRYR to monitor the lake-atmosphere interaction and the differences among water-heat exchanges over the land and lake surfaces. This study presents an eight-year (2012–19), half-hourly, observation-based dataset related to lake–atmosphere interactions composed of three sites. The three sites represent the lake surface, the lakeside, and the land. The observations contain the basic meteorological elements, surface radiation, eddy covariance system, soil temperature, and moisture (for land). Information related to the sites and instruments, the continuity and completeness of data, and the differences among the observational results at different sites are described in this study. These data have been used in the previous study to reveal a few energy and water exchange characteristics of TP lakes and to validate and improve the lake and land surface model. The dataset is available at National Cryosphere Desert Data Center and Science Data Bank.},

This study applied a series of offline regional simulations of the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) over the TRSR to evaluate the impacts of regional climate and vegetation change on runoff. Firstly, we evaluated the performance of runoff depth using CLM5.0, the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency between the simulated and observed runoff of TNH and ZMD gage stations are 0.56 and 0.51, respectively. The climate on the TRSR shows a warming and wetting trend, with the fastest warming rate in DJF (December, January, and February) and the fastest wetting rate in JJA (June, July, and August). Runoff increases in most of the TRSR with increased precipitation and decreases in the southeast of the Yellow River Source Region (YRSR). With increasing temperature, the simulated runoff shows a decreasing trend, while runoff tends to increase with precipitation enhancement over the TRSR. The results indicated that precipitation is the dominant factor affecting evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff, whilst the contribution of increasing temperature to runoff is 12%, which plays a regulatory role in the increased streamflow. In addition, Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) in CLM5.0 was used to study the impact of vegetation change on runoff. Compared to the static vegetation, the simulated leaf area index (LAI) from the DGVM shows an increasing trend in most regions of the TRSR and the runoff in the TRSR decreases by 33%.},

The coupled WRF-Hydro simulations are better than WRF in terms of six ground meteorological elements and turbulent heat flux, compared to the data from 14 meteorological stations located in the plateau residential area and two flux stations located around the lake. Although WRF-Hydro overestimates soil moisture, higher anomaly correlation coefficient scores (0.955 versus 0.941) were achieved. The time series of the basin average demonstrates that the hydrological module of WRF-hydro functions during the unfrozen period. The rainfall intensity and frequency simulated by WRF-Hydro are closer to global precipitation mission (GPM) data, attributed to higher convective available potential energy (CAPE) simulated by WRF-Hydro.

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) contributes to the physical and chemical characters of coastal waters by discharging nutrients and contaminants, significantly impacting regional marine ecosystems and contributing to ocean chemical budgets. However, such groundwater discharge varies dramatically across scales and is often not comparable due to different model assumptions and field designs. We used a hydrologic model with integration of fundamental surface and subsurface processes to simulate the coastline level fresh SGD for the Crete Island in the Mediterranean Sea. The modeled hydrological processes suggested that fresh SGD substantially contributes to water flow entering the Mediterranean Sea (2.3 × 108 m3/yr), amounting to 31% of river discharge and 14% of precipitation. Spatially, fresh SGD varied from 2.4 m3/yr/m to 13.4 × 104 m3/yr/m, with an average of 2.6 × 103 m3/yr/m. The local maxima were commonly associated with river mouths reflecting larger hydraulic gradients and higher permeable structures. Temporally, fresh SGD was impacted by episodic precipitation in a delayed and prolonged pattern. We found that fresh SGD variability at the coastline segment level was compared to point measurements and fresh SGD magnitudes summered up to the catchment level were consistent with global products. Our results suggest the coupled surface–subsurface hydrologic modeling approach is a promising strategy to quantify and partition large-scale water budgets down to point observations that typically do not capture the full range of fresh SGD dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract. The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic–ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.},

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Hydrological modeling is an essential strategy for understanding natural flows, particularly where observations are lacking in either space or time, or where topographic roughness leads to a disconnect in the characteristic timescales of overland and groundwater flow. Consequently, significant opportunities remain for the development of extensible modeling systems that operate robustly across regions. Towards the development of such a robust hydrological modeling system, this paper introduces the Solver for Hydrological Unstructured Domain (SHUD), an integrated multi-process, multi-scale, multi-timestep hydrological model, in which hydrological processes are fully coupled using the Finite Volume Method. The SHUD integrates overland flow, snow accumulation/melting, evapotranspiration, subsurface and groundwater flow, and river routing, while realistically capturing the physical processes in a watershed. The SHUD incorporates one-dimension unsaturated flow, two-dimension groundwater flow, and river channels connected with hillslopes via overland flow and baseflow.</p> <p> This paper introduces the design of SHUD, from the conceptual and mathematical description of hydrological processes in a watershed to computational structures. To demonstrate and validate the model performance, we employ three hydrological experiments: the V-Catchment experiment, Vauclin's experiment, and a study of the Cache Creek Watershed in northern California, USA.</p> <p> Possible applications of then SHUD model include hydrological studies from the hillslope scale to regional scale, water resource and stormwater management, and coupling research with related fields such as limnology, agriculture, geochemistry, geomorphology, water quality, and ecology, climatic and landuse change. In general, SHUD is a valuable scientific tool for any modeling task involving simulating and understanding the hydrological response.</p>},

abstract = {In this study, a novel temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN) model is developed for long-term streamflow projection in California within the Catchment Attributes for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS) watershed regions. The TCNN model consists of several convolution blocks and causal convolution is used as physical constraint. The ensemble performance of the model is first compared with other machine learning models for streamflow prediction. The model is further assessed through comparison with reduced models and using different hyperparameters, with results suggesting that this model correctly ascertains the physical relationship between input variables and streamflow. The stability of the model and its behavior in the extrapolated regime is assessed through an idealized extreme test with quadruple precipitation and 5°C higher temperature. Future streamflow projections are then developed using daily high-resolution Localized Constructed Analogs dataset (LOCA). To understand the importance of the nonlinear machine learning approach, we estimate the degree of nonlinearity in the streamflow response among input variables. Our work shows the ability and potential for TCNNs to perform future hydrology projections.},

abstract = {Recent debate over the scope of the U.S. Clean Water Act underscores the need to develop a robust body of scientific work that defines the connectivity between freshwater systems and people. Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual-empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.},

@phdthesis{Shu2017,
abstract = {The past one hundred years have seen a tremendous migration to towns and cities worldwide. This population movement exerts serious impacts on surface and ground-water supplies, soil health, and the sustainability of ecosystems. At the same time, climate change has become a decisive influence on water systems as land conversion continues. Historically, urbanization and climate change were two important determinants in the sustainability of water, food and energy supplies, as well as the increasing risk of environmental hazards. At the watershed scale the evolving land use change in urban areas does not only change the flood risk because of increasing impervious areas or by directly reducing the consumption of water by trees and plants, but also fundamentally alters the local water balance and the partitioning of water within the land-atmosphereecological system. Both land use change and climate change may influence the urban watershed in ways that reinforce or compensate sustainable management. In this study we applied two spatially explicit models to the problem. One is the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), a hydrologic model that partitions the water balance in space and time over the urban catchment. The other is the Cellular Automata Land Use Change Model (CALUC), a land use change model, which simulates the evolution of land use classes based on physical measures associated with population change and land use demand factors. We selected two study sites, one modern and one ancient, to highlight the capability of coupling catchment hydrology with land use change models. The goal is to assess the role of hydrologic change in urbanizing watersheds and to evaluate the contemporaneous impacts of climate change. The modern sites are the Conestoga watershed and the Lancaster PA urban center; the historical site is the ancient Maya city of Tikal in Peten region of Guatemala. In each setting, the essential data was developed and the models were used to evaluate how urbanization and land use change gradually altered the entire water balance often in unexpected ways. Chapter 1 introduces the overall problem and carries out a comprehensive literature review for each of the following chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the relevant models used in the study, and the role of model parameterization, particularly the important role that macropores have on maintaining a healthy soil and supporting soil moisture and recharge to groundwater. Chapter 2 also describes the Cellular Automata Land Use Change model, which is adopted here to simulate land use conditions. Chapter 3 then evaluates the past, present and future land use conditions in the Conestoga watershed and develops quantitative metrics of evaluation. Chapter 4 extends the Conestoga case study to evaluate hydrologic performance when dynamic land use and future climate change scenarios from IPCC are the drivers. An evaluation of the relative importance of land use and climate to hydrologic change is presented. Chapter 5 implements the models in a retrospective scenario of the water history of the ancient Maya city of Tikal and discusses the problem of urbanization-deforestation-agriculture land conversion, and the likely sensitivity of their water supply to extreme climate events. Chapter 6 summarizes the two case studies and makes inferences on the resilience and elasticity of the two study sites to climate and land use change.},

abstract = {Environmental and water issues are essentially complex interdisciplinary problems. Multiple models from different disciplines are usually integrated to solve those problems. Integrated modeling environment is an effective technical approach to model integration. Although a number of modeling environments worldwide are available, they cannot meet current challenges faced. Their old-fashion designs and original development purposes constrain their possible applications to the domain of hydrologic or land surface modeling. One of the challenges is that we intend to link knowledge database or ontology system to the modeling environment in order to make the modeling support more intelligent and powerful. In this paper, we designed and implemented an integrated modeling environment (HIME) for hydrological and land surface modeling purpose in a much extendable, efficient and easy use manner. With such design, a physical process was implemented as a module, or component. A new model can be generated in an intuitive way by linking module icons together and establishing their relationships. Following an introduction to the overall architecture, the designs for module linkage and data transfer between modules are described in details. Using XML based meta-information, modules in either source codes or binary form can be utilized by the environment. As a demonstration, with the help of HIME, we replaced the evaporation module of TOPMODEL with the evapotranspiration module from the Noah land surface model which explicitly accounts for vegetation transpiration. This example showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the modeling environment on model integration. {\textcopyright} 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) contributes to the physical and chemical characters of coastal waters by discharging nutrients and contaminants, significantly impacting regional marine ecosystems and contributing to ocean chemical budgets. However, such groundwater discharge varies dramatically across scales and is often not comparable due to different model assumptions and field designs. We used a hydrologic model with integration of fundamental surface and subsurface processes to simulate the coastline level fresh SGD for the Crete Island in the Mediterranean Sea. The modeled hydrological processes suggested that fresh SGD substantially contributes to water flow entering the Mediterranean Sea (2.3 × 108 m3/yr), amounting to 31% of river discharge and 14% of precipitation. Spatially, fresh SGD varied from 2.4 m3/yr/m to 13.4 × 104 m3/yr/m, with an average of 2.6 × 103 m3/yr/m. The local maxima were commonly associated with river mouths reflecting larger hydraulic gradients and higher permeable structures. Temporally, fresh SGD was impacted by episodic precipitation in a delayed and prolonged pattern. We found that fresh SGD variability at the coastline segment level was compared to point measurements and fresh SGD magnitudes summered up to the catchment level were consistent with global products. Our results suggest the coupled surface–subsurface hydrologic modeling approach is a promising strategy to quantify and partition large-scale water budgets down to point observations that typically do not capture the full range of fresh SGD dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding how the biological invasion is driven by environmental factors will improve model prediction and advance early detection, especially in the context of accelerating anthropogenic ecological changes. Although a large body of studies has examined how favorable environments promote biological invasions, a more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of invasive species response to unfavorable/stressful conditions is still developing. Grass invasion has been problematic across the globe; in particular, C4 grass invaders, with high drought tolerance, adaptations to high temperatures, and high water use efficiency, could become more severe. Here, we conducted a rigorous microcosm experiment, with one of the most damaging invasive C4 grass - cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), to explore how cogongrass responds to soil water and nutrient stress. We further integrated the results of the microcosm study with a species distribution model to (1) corroborate greenhouse results with field observations and (2) validate the robustness of our findings at sub-continental scales. Both the microcosm experiments and species distribution model agreed that soil water stress had a stronger impact on cogongrass than the nutrient one. New vegetative growth of cogongrass continued to be inhibited by the prior water stress. The significant water effect on cogongrass total biomass was supported by the finding that both allometric and biochemical traits of cogongrass did not show significant responses to the changes in water treatment. Different to the conventional wisdom that nutrient enrichment plays a bigger role in facilitating biological invasions, this study highlighted the possibility that water conditions may have a more substantial effect on some aggressive invaders. Therefore, an important implication of this study on biological conservation is that field managers might take advantage of the negative effect of global drought on some invasive species to increase the efficiency of their controlling efforts because invasive species may become more vulnerable under drought effect.},

@article{Gil2021,
abstract = {Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort. We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.},

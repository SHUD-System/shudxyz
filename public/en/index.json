As a heritage of Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), the SHUD model is a continuation of 16 years of PIHM modeling in hydrology and related fields since the release of its first PIHM version (Qu, 2004).\nThe SHUD’s design is based on a concise representation of a watershed and river basin’s hydrodynamics, which allows for interactions among major physical processes operating simultaneously, but with the flexibility to add or drop states/processes/constitutive relations depending on the objectives of the numerical experiment for research purpose.\nThe SHUD is a distributed hydrological model in which the domain is discretized using an unstructured triangular irregular network (e.g., Delaunay triangles) generated with constraints (geometric and parametric). A local prismatic control volume is formed by the vertical projection of the Delaunay triangles forming each layer of the model. Given a set of constraints (river network, watershed boundary, elevation, and hydraulic properties), an “optimized mesh” is generated. The “optimized mesh” indicates the hydrological processes with the unstructured mesh can be calculated efficiently, stably and rationally (Farthing \u0026amp; Ogden, 2017; Vanderstraeten and Keunings, 1995; Kumar, Bhatt and Duffy, 2009). River volume cells are also prismatic, with trapezoidal or rectangular cross-section, and maintain the topological relation with the Delaunay triangles. The local control volumes encapsulate all equations to be solved and are herein referred to as the model kernel.\nAcknowledge We deeply acknowledge the continuous scientific and financial support to the SHUD development activities by following institutions:\nChinese Academy of Sciences Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences Pennsylvania State University University of California Davis National Science Foundation United States Environmental Protection Agency The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"18534ef9e09a7dcec4e0375039d892d4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/shud/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/shud/","section":"shud","summary":"Overview of the SHUD modeling system.","tags":null,"title":"SHUD modeling system","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Formulation and results of SHUD SHUD is a physically-based model, in which all equations used to emerge from the physics behind the hydrological processes within a catchment. The physical model can predict the water in an ungaged water system. SHUD represents the spatial heterogeneity that influences the hydrology of the region. Consequently, it is practical to couple the SHUD model with models from biochemistry, reaction transport, geomorphology, limnology and other related research areas. SHUD is a fully-coupled hydrological model, where the conservative hydrological fluxes are calculated within the same time step. The state variables are the height of ponding water on the land surface, soil moisture, groundwater level, and river stage, while fluxes are infiltration, overland flow, groundwater recharge, lateral groundwater flow, river discharge, and exchange between river and cells. The global ODE system solved in SHUD integrates all local ODE systems over the domain and solves with a state-of-the-art parallel ODE solver known as CVODE (Hindmarsh et al., 2005) developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. SHUD permits adaptable temporal and spatial resolution. The spatial resolution of the model varies from cen- timeters to kilometers based on modeling requirements computing resources. The internal time step of the iteration is adjustable; it can export the status of a catchment at time-intervals from a minutes to days. The flexible spatial and temporal resolution of the model is valuable for community model coupling. SHUD can estimate either a long-term hydrological yield or a single-event flood. SHUD is an open-source model — anyone can access the source code and submit their modifications/improvements. Standing on the shoulders of giants Brief history of PIHM The conceptual structure of the two-state integral-balance model for soil moisture and groundwater dynamics is devised by (Duffy, 1996), in which the partial volumes occupied by unsaturated and saturated moisture storage were integrated di- rectly upon local conservation equation. This two-state integral-balance structure simplified the hydrological dynamics while preserving the natural spatial and temporal scales contributing to runoff response. Brandes et al. (1998) use FEMWATER to realize the numeric calculation of inflow/outflow behavior within a hillslope-stream scheme. In 2004, Qu (2004) embedded the evapotranspiration and river network, and released Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) v1.0, which is the most important milestone of the two-state integral-balance model. Since PIHM v1.0 (Qu, 2004), the PIHM is a generic hydrological model applicable to various watersheds or basins. After that, PIHM v2.0 (Kumar et al., 2009; Kumar and Duffy, 2009) enhance the land surface modeling. A GIS-tool, PIHMgis(Bhatt et al., 2014) and the Essential Terrestrial Variables Data Server (HydroTerre Leonard and Duffy (2013)) dramatically motivated the model deployment and applications with PIHM. Because of the sophisticated hydrological modeling and efficient spatial representative of PIHM, various model coupling project ini- tialized. For example, Flux-PIHM coupled the NOAH Land Surface Model into PIHM to calculate more details in energy balance and evapotranspiration (Shi et al., 2015, 2014). Zhang et al. (2016) coupled the landscaping evolution with PIHM (LE-PIHM). Bao (Bao, 2016; Bao et al., 2017) coupled the reaction transport module with PIHM (RT-PIHM, RT-Flux-PIHM). Flux-PIHM-BGC (Shi et al., 2018) coupled the biogeochemistry into Flux-PIHM. The Multi-Module PIHM (MM-PIHM) project (https://github.com/PSUmodeling/MM-PIHM) planned to build a uniform repository for all coupled modules. Still, more PIHM coupling projects are ongoing, such as sediments, lakes, crops, etc.. In addition, a finite volume-based integrated hydrologic modeling (FIHM) was developed (Kumar et al., 2009), which used second-order accuracy and solved 2D unsteady overland flow and 3D subsurface flow. Figure 1 shows the family tree of PIHM and SHUD. Every revision/branch received cross-pollination from others. Although PIHM and SHUD share the same fundamental conceptual two-state integral model, both the input/output are incompatible. Details of differences between them are summarised in the last section of this paper.\nFigure 1 The family tree of PIHM and SHUD.

The unstructured grids are opting to represent the heterogeneity of terrestrial properties, including elevation, slope, soil, and land use, rather than regular grids. The particular points and edges in the terrestrial map can be assigned during mesh generation, but it is hard to be adapted in regular grids. Unstructured grids are so flexible that the size of cells can be adjusted based on modeling purposes. For example, when the modeler needs more details on a certain area of a large watershed, he/she can give fine resolution in the research area, but the coarser resolution of the rest of the watershed while keeping the interaction between fine and coarse resolution areas. Unstructured grids are more natural and more suitable to represent the complex boundary (such as watershed boundary) than the regular grids. When the modeling domain is of the irregular and complex boundary, regular grids have to use high resolution everywhere to represent the boundary that increases computing burden. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_classification\nWhat is the difference between SHUD and PIHM model?\nAs a descendant of PIHM, SHUD inherits the fundamental idea of conceptual structure and solving hydrological variables in CVODE. The code has been completely rewritten in a new programming language, with a new discretization and corresponding improvements to the underlying algorithms, adapting new mathematical schemes and a new user-friendly input/output data format. Although SHUD is forked from PIHM’s track, SHUD still inherits the use of CVODE for solving the ODE system but modernizes and extends PIHM’s technical and scientific capabilities.\nThe major differences are the following:\nSHUD is written in C++, an object-oriented programming language with functionality to avoid risky memory leaks from C. Every function in the code has been rewritten, so the functions, algorithm or data structure between SHUD and PIHM are incompatible. SHUD implements a redesign of the calculation of water exchange between hillslope and river. The PIHM defines the river channel as adjacent to bank cells – namely, the river channel shares the edges with bank cells. This design leads to sink problems in cells that share one node with a starting river channel. The mathematical equations used in infiltration, recharge, overland flow and river discharge are different among the two models. This change is so essential that the model results would be different with the same parameter set. SHUD adds mass-balance control within the calculation of each layer of cells and river channels, critical for long-term or micro-scale hydrologic modeling. Either inner data structure or external input/output formats are different. The inner data structure indicates the organization of data, parameters and operations within the program, as well as the strategy to connect the various procedures in the program. The format of input files for SHUD model is upgraded to a series of straightforward and user-friendly formats. The output of SHUD model supports both ASCII and Binary format. Particularly, the binary format is efficient in writing and post-processing. We now briefly summarize the technical model improvements and technical capabilities of the model, compared to PIHM. This elaboration of the relevant technical features aims to assist future developers and advanced users with model coupling. Compared with PIHM, SHUD …\nsupports the latest implicit Sundial/CVODE solver up to version 5.0.0 (the most recent version at the time of writing), supports OpenMP parallel computation, redesigns the program with object-oriented programming (C++), supports human-readable input/output files and filenames, exposes unified functions to handle the time-series data, including forcing, leaf area index, roughness length, boundary conditions and melt factor, exports model initial condition at specific intervals that can be used for warm starts of continued simulation, automatically checks the range of physical parameters and forcing data, adds a debug mode that monitors potential errors in parameters and memory operations. What kind of data is needed for SHUD model simulation?\nSpatial Data: Elevation, watershed boundary, river network, soil map, geology map, landuse and coverage of forcing data.

If you need, please email to Lele Shu\nCache Creek Watershed The Cache Creek Watershed (CCW) is a headwater catchment with area $196.4 km^2$ in the Sacramento Watershed in Northern California (Fig. below (a), (b) and (c)). The elevation ranges from $450 m$ to $1800 m$, with a $0.38 m/m$ average slope which is very steep, and hence a particularly difficult watershed for hydrologic models to simulate.\nAccording to NLDAS-2, between 2000 and 2017 the mean temperature and precipitation was $12.8 ^\\circ C$ and $\\approx 817 mm\u000b$, respectively, in this catchment. Precipitation is unevenly distributed through the year, with winter and spring precipitation being the vast majority of the contribution to the annual total (Fig. below).\nSHUD simulation and calibration Our simulation in CCW covers the period from 2000 to 2007. Because of the Mediterranean climate in this region, the simulation starts in summer to ensure adequate time before the October start to the water year. In our experiment, the first year (2000-06-01 to 2001-06-30) is the spin-up period, the following two years (2001-07-01 to 2003-06-30 ) are the calibration period, and the period from 2003-07-01 to 2007-07-01 is for validation.\nThe unstructured domain of the CCW (Fig. 1(d)) is built with rSHUD, a R package on GitHub (rSHUD). The number of triangular cells is 1147, with a mean area of $ 0.17 km^2\u000b$. The total length of the river network is $126.5 km\u000b$ and consists of 103 river reaches and in which the highest order of stream is 4. With a calibrated parameter set, the SHUD model tooks 5 hours to simulate 17 years in the CCW, with a non-parallel configuration (OpenMP is disabled on Mac Pro 2013 Xeon 2.7GHz, 32GB RAM).\nResults Figure below reveals the comparison of simulated discharge against the observed discharge at the gage station of USGS 11451100. The calibration procedure exploits the Covariance Matrix Adaptation – Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to calibrate automatically \\citep{Hansen2016}. The calibration program assigns 72 children in each generation and keeps the best child as the seed for next-generation, with limited perturbations. The perturbation for the next generation is generated from the covariance matrix of the previous generation. After 23 generations, the calibration tool identifies a locally optimal parameter set.\nWe use the groundwater distribution (Fig. below) to demonstrate the spatial distribution of hydroligcal metrics calculated from the SHUD model.\nFigure below illustrates the annual mean groundwater table in the validation period. Because the model fixes a $30 m$ aquifer, the results represent the groundwater within this aquifer only. The groundwater table and elevation along the green line on the upper map are extracted and plotted in the bottom figure. The gray ribbon is the $30 m$ aquifer, and the blue line is the location where groundwater storage is larger than zero. The green polygons with the right axis are the groundwater storage along the cross-section. The groundwater follows the terrain, with groundwater accumulated in the valley, or along relatively flat plains. In the CCW, the groundwater is very deep or does not stay on the steep slope.\n","date":1574406907,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574406907,"objectID":"29138867fc34eca825691aa0357dfcd9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/shud/3-applications/ccw/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:15:07-07:00","relpermalink":"/en/shud/3-applications/ccw/","section":"shud","summary":"Code is available at and Github: https://github.com/Model-Intercomparison-Datasets/Cache-Creek.

The experiment was conducted in a sandbox with dimension 3 m long $ \\times $ 2 m deep $\\times $ 0.05 m wide. The box was filled with uniform sand particles with measured hydraulic parameters: the saturated hydraulic conductivity was $35 cm/hr $ and porosity was $0.33$ m$^3$/m$^3$. The left and bottom of the sandbox were impervious layers, and the top and the right side were open. A hydraulic head was set constant at $0.65 m$. Constant irrigation ($1.48$ cm/hr) was applied over the first $50$ cm of the top-left of the sandbox while the rest of the top was covered to avoid water loss via evaporation.\nThe experiment’s initial condition is an equilibrium water table under constant hydraulic head from the right side. That is, the saturated water table across the sandbox was kept stable at $0.65$ m. When the groundwater table reached equilibrium, irrigation was initiated at $t = 0$. The groundwater table was then measured at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours at several locations along the length of the box.\nBesides the parameters specified in [@Vauclin1979], additional information is needed by the SHUD, including the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in the van Genutchen equation and water content ($\\theta _s$). Therefore, we use a calibration tool to estimate the representative values of these parameters. The use of calibration in this simulation is reasonable because the model – inevitably – simplifies the real hydraulic processes. The calibration thus nudges the parameters to representative values that approach or fit the true natural processes. The calibrated values are $\\theta _s = 0.32 m^3/m^3$, $\\alpha = 6.0$ and $\\beta = 6.0$. Like the simulated results in [@Vauclin1979] and [@Shen2010], a mismatch exists between the simulations and measurements. This mismatch may be due to (1) the aquifer description of unsaturated and saturated layers limiting the capability to simulate infiltration and recharge in the unsaturated zone, or (2) the horizontal unsaturated flow assumptions no longer hold at the relatively microscopic scales of this experiment.\nThe SHUD simulated the groundwater table at all four measurement points (see Figure). The maximum bias between simulation and Vauclin’s observations is $ 4.6cm$, with $R^2$ = $0.99$. When the calibration takes more soil parameters into account, the bias in simulation decreases to $3 cm$. Certainly, the simplifications employed by SHUD for the unsaturated and saturated zone benefits the computation efficiency while limiting the applicability of the model for micro-scale problems.\nThe simulations, compared against Vauclin’s experiment, validate the algorithm for infiltration, recharge, and lateral groundwater flow. More reliable vertical flow within unsaturated layer requires multiple layers, which is planned in next version of SHUD.\n","date":1574406907,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574406907,"objectID":"a52748fcafa1334e4a519bb2b860c534","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/shud/3-applications/vauclin/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:15:07-07:00","relpermalink":"/en/shud/3-applications/vauclin/","section":"shud","summary":"Vauclin’s experiment [@Vauclin1979] is designed to assess groundwater table change and soil moisture in the unsaturated layer under precipitation or irrigation.

By integrating high-resolution terrestrial and meteorological data, the SHUD model simulates streamflow variations and other hydrological characteristics, providing valuable insights into the region’s water balance and runoff processes. Key findings reveal a consistent upward trend in precipitation and temperature over the past four decades, despite minor deviations in daily precipitation intensity and relative humidity data. The SHUD model demonstrates high accuracy on a monthly scale, with Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.72 for the calibration phase and 0.61 for the validation phase. The corresponding Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values are 0.73 and 0.49, respectively, underscoring the model’s applicability for hydrological forecasting and water resource management. Notably, the annual runoff ratios for the Buha River fluctuate annually between 0.11 and 0.21, with significant changes around 2007 correlating with a shift in Qinghai Lake’s water levels. The analysis of water balance indicates a net leakage over long-term periods, with spatial alterations in leakage and replenishment along the river. Furthermore, snow accumulation, which increases with altitude, significantly contributes to streamflow during the melting season. Despite the Buha River basin’s importance, research on its hydrology remains limited due to data scarcity and minimal human activity. This study enhances the understanding of the Buha River’s hydrological processes and highlights the necessity for improved dataset accuracy and model parameter optimization in future research.","tags":["Buha River","Qinghai Lake","streamflow change","hydrological model","CMFD data"],"title":"Comprehensive Hydrological Analysis of the Buha River Watershed with High-Resolution SHUD Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["舒乐乐","陈昊","孟宪红","常燕","胡立堂","王文科","束龙仓","俞烜","Christopher DUFFY","姚莹莹","郑东海"],"categories":null,"content":"数值水文模型综述。\nHow to cite. 舒乐乐, 陈昊, 孟宪红, 常燕, 胡立堂, 王文科, 束龙仓, 俞烜, Duffy C, 姚莹莹, 郑东海. 2024. 地表-地下过程耦合的数值水文模型综述. 中国科 学: 地球科学, 54(5): 1484–1505, doi: 10.1360/SSTe-2022-0420\n","date":1718150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718150400,"objectID":"cda8c5b9697d25cc122faa347419a428","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/publication/2024shu_scichina/","publishdate":"2024-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2024shu_scichina/","section":"publication","summary":"水文模型是利用数学公式对水文循环过程的描述, 是理解自然界水的时空运动和分布规律的重要工具; 它不仅可以利用观测数据来验证理论的可靠性与适宜性, 还能预测水文变量未来趋势, 实现理解自然与预测自然的目的. 随着计算方法的快速发展、观测与试验手段的持续更新, 目前基于物理过程的地表-地下过程耦合的数值水文模型快速发展. 这种模型以微观尺度的守恒原理和物理公式为基础, 利用数值方法将地表和地下水流进行耦合计算, 从而模拟流域尺度水文响应过程. 由于其物理过程明确、时空分辨率高且利于学科耦合, 数值水文模型已成为水文模型发展的前沿和主流方向之一. 本文阐述了地表-地下过程耦合数值水文模型的理论基础, 从模型框架、数值求解方法、空间表达和耦合算法等方面对比和分析了当前主流数值水文模型, 同时与传统水文模型比较, 厘清了数值水文模型的优劣势, 探讨了未来数值水文模型发展的方向.","tags":["Biological invasion"],"title":"地表-地下过程耦合的数值水文模型综述","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lele Shu","Xiaodong Li","Yan Chang","Xianhong Meng","Hao Chen","Yuan Qi","Hongwei Wang","Zhaoguo Li","Shihua Lyu"],"categories":null,"content":"How to cite.

Yet, these complex dynamics are often insufficiently captured in existing hydrological models, such as the bi-direction surface and subsurface flow. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel lake–watershed coupled model, an enhancement of the Simulator of Hydrological Unstructured Domains. This high-resolution, distributed model employs unstructured triangles as its fundamental hydrological computing units (HCUs), offering a physical approach to hydrological modeling. We validated our model using data from Qinghai Lake in China, spanning from 1979 to 2018. Remarkably, the model not only successfully simulated the streamflow of the Buha River, a key river within the Qinghai Lake basin, achieving a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.62 and 0.76 for daily and monthly streamflow, respectively, but also accurately reproduced the decrease–increase U-shaped curve of lake level change over the past 40 years, with an NSE of 0.71. Our model uniquely distinguishes the contributions of various components to the lake's long-term water balance, including river runoff, surface direct runoff, lateral groundwater contribution, direct evaporation, and precipitation. This work underscores the potential of our coupled model as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting hydrological processes in lake basins, thereby contributing to more effective water resource management and climate change mitigation strategies.","tags":["SHUD","Qinghai Lake"],"title":"Scaling up experimental stress responses of grass invasion to predictions of continental‐level range suitability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lele Shu","Paul Ullrich","Xianhong Meng","Christopher Duffy","Hao Chen","Zhaoguo Li"],"categories":null,"content":"How to cite.

However, achieving reproducibility and automation in distributed hydrological modeling research for modeling, simulation, and analysis is challenging. This paper intro- duces rSHUD v2.0, an innovative, open-source toolkit developed in the R environment to enhance the deployment and analysis of the Simulator for Hydrologic Unstructured Domains (SHUD). The SHUD is an integrated surface– subsurface hydrological model that employs a finite-volume method to simulate hydrological processes at various scales. The rSHUD toolkit includes pre- and post-processing tools, facilitating reproducibility and automation in hydrological modeling.

Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort. We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.","tags":["SHUD","Hydrological Model","AI","Watershed","Hydrology"],"title":"Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Complex Systems: Taming the Complexity of Expert Models to Improve Decision Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhang, Bo","Yuan, Yingdan","Shu, Lele","Grosholz, Edwin","Guo, Yuxi","Hastings, Alan","Cuda, James P","Zhang, Jinchi","Zhai, Lu","Qiu, Jiangxiao"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Understanding how the biological invasion is driven by environmental factors will improve model prediction and advance early detection, especially in the context of accelerating anthropogenic ecological changes.

Paniconi et al. 2015; Peel and McMahon, 2020; Fatichi et al. 2016; Hrachowitz and Clark, 2017)。2000年以来，全球水文研究者新发展了20多个重要的数值方法水文模型(Peel and McMahon; 2020)，包括Mike SHE, ParFlow, CATHY, PAWS, HydroGeoSphere, PIHM, SHUD等。\n数值方法水文模型的特点 针对数值方法水文模型的特点总结是基于与其他非数值方法的水文模型进行的对比。\n显著优势 强物理过程描述：数值模型常基于物理公式（如达西定律、理查兹方程、圣维南方程、格林-安普公式等）描述流域水文过程。数值模型的参数多基于可测量水力学参数，如土壤水力传导度、土壤孔隙度、地表粗糙度等。数值模型由最基本原理描述来求解整体流域响应，属于自下而上方法，更能表现模拟客观性；即在流域物理过程和空间结构表达上，物理性模型优于概念模型和集总式模型，并且物理性模型有利于无径流观测流域的研究突破。集总式和半分布式模型中常用抽象参数表达重要的水文物理过程，例如SWAT的产流过程由CN值（Curve Number）决定，CN值综合了土壤、土地利用、农业管理、坡度等多个水文信息。 高时间分辨率：由于分布式流域水文模型的高分辨率，依据CFL条件限制，数值模型的时间分辨率运行在秒至小时级别，对于描述流域变化的快过程有显著优势，例如描述洪水过境、洪水淹没以及水化学过程。部分模型具有自适应时间步长——模型算法根据变化速度及系统收敛状况，自动调整时间步长，既显著提高模型整体运行效率，又满足数值计算的收敛性要求。数值模型的对比试验中，由于其模拟对象尺度较小，诸多模型的时间步长在0.001秒至30分钟之间（Kollet et al. 2017)。\n空间连续性：空间连续性表现为，水文变量在较高分辨率的离散空间内的连续过程，例如水沿着“山顶-半坡-坡脚-河道-河流出口”地表或地下路径传播过程都可以在数值模型中进行跟踪。与之对比，SWAT以水文响应单元为单元计算水的产汇流，但无法描述水从HRU最远点到河流的过程，因而也无法描述污染物在HRU内的传播路径。 地表-地下耦合：更真实地表述了地表地下水的交互过程，同时增强了模型在不同流域的通用性。例如大部分概念性模型固定了地下水向河流的流向——坡面流向河道；因此无法使用统一方法表达干旱地区河流在干旱季节渗漏补给地下水，湿润季节地下水补给河流的过程。数值模型的地表地下紧耦合方法中，地下水与河流交互方向由实时水力梯度决定，即水可以双向流动。传统的以子流域分割的水文模型中，子流域的地下水直接贡献给其径流，并推演至流域出口。这种计算方式在部分山区，无法反映高山区地下水补给，通过深层地下水路径补给给末端径流的过程，而数值方法耦合地表地下方式则可胜任。 土地利用的水力学表达：模型中通过蒸发、地表径流、植被物候规律以及土壤特性变化四个方面来体现土地利用，有效地表达了土地利用的水力学特征。对比SWAT模型，其土地利用特征由CN值表达，CN值缺少足够物理性而难以测量；CN值同时包含土壤透水性和土地利用导致的粗糙度与不透水面积，并且难以表达物候特征，因此模型不确定性较大。 可计算的空间变量多：数值方法模型在水平和垂直方向进行空间划分，因此总体的计算单元数量多，形成三维的计算结果，模拟产生的数据量远大于集总式和半分布式模型，模型高分辨率输出有利于与观测对比，也能更好的指导未来观测布设。\n利于学科模型紧密耦合：由于数值模型物理机制明确、可计算变量丰富、满足守恒条件约束，并且可以跟踪物质在空间的传输过程，奠定了与其他学科模型深度耦合的理论基础。前文提到的空间连续性有利于多学科的耦合研究，例如模型详细描述水从山坡汇流的路径，方便进行陆面过程（Shi et al. 2015, Kuffour et al. 2020）、地球化学（Shi et al. 2018）、污染物运动(Bao et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017)、农业经济（Cobourn et al. 2018），湖泊动态（Ladwig et al. 2021)、土壤侵蚀及地貌变迁(Yu et al. 2016)， 冰冻圈过程（冰川、冻土、积雪）耦合（Endrizzi et al. 2014）等方面的模型耦合。典型的模型耦合案例包括CLM-PAWS(Shen et al. 2014), CLM-ParFlow(Kuffour et al. 2020), ATS(Painter et al. 2016) Flux-PIHM(Shi et al. 2013), LE-PIHM(Yu et al. 2016)，tRIBS-VEGGIE(Ivanov et al. 2008)等。\n限制因素 参数要求高以及不确定性：参数要求高表现为数量多、可靠性要求高、物理性要求高，调参难度大（Maxwell et al. 2005）。Beven等（Beven 2010）认为集总式模型仅需要3-6个参数即可准确模拟“降雨-产流”过程，但是数值模型由于其控制方程数量以及流域水文过程的复杂性导致其参数数量较高。以水力传导度(Hydraulic Conductivity, K)为例，在SWAT等模型中只需要一个K值，但是SHUD模型(Shu et al. 2020)中，至少需要三个K值，即地表垂直方向、地下垂直方向和地下水平方向三个K值。 SWAT利用CN表达了土壤水利特征、土地利用特征和农业管理，但数值模型通常需要超过10参数表达以上特征。 数值模型中的参数通常具有具体的物理意义，且参数敏感性较强，因此参数的可靠性直接决定模拟结果的优劣。物理参数的值变化范围被限定在特定的合理范围，并且由于其参数数量大，调参的难度大；且无法避免多参同效（Equafinality）问题（Beven 2010）。常见数值方法水文模型自动化调参都采用遗传算法(Hansen 2011; Yu et al. 2014, 2021）。 运行效率不高：数值模型运行在较高的空间分辨率上，由CFL条件决定其运行的时间不长较高，因此总体上其运行效率远低于传统的建立于天尺度的“降雨-产流”模型。计算效率低的主要原因有三个：1）空间HCU数量大，分辨率高；2）计算时间步长小；3）求解方法复杂，模型需要迭代寻找收敛点，\n建模过程复杂：建模过程复杂表现为：1）水平空间分割复杂，水平空间的分割常见为规则（规则化四边形、三角形、六边形）或不规则分割（三角形、四边形或混合性质）；2）垂直空间分割复杂，包含固定距离分割、水文特征分割或动态分割等；3）空间拓扑关系复杂，主要是指不同计算单元间的耦合关系，包括陆面过程与水文过程的交互关系、显式河道与坡面单元的交互关系等。\n开发难度大：数值方法水文模型涉及的物理过程众多、数学求解难度大、参数众多、计算资源要求高、模型调试复杂等特点，使得其开发难度大。现有数值模型大多都是多人团队经过多年开发方成形。例如SHUD模型，纵使有PIHM从2004至2020的17年的研究积累，SHUD依然经历6年开发历程。另以PawFlow为例，从其github的代码开发历史看，三人团队研究6年后发布了ParFlow第一版本，其后陆续发布了更新版本，但是合作团队美国普林斯顿大学、科罗拉多矿业大学、华盛顿州立大学、雪城大学、劳伦斯-利佛摩国家实验室，德国的伯恩大学、利希研究中心、地球系统超算中心，法国地球环境研究所等在内的多家实力雄厚的大学和研究机构（见https://parflow.org/#team），足见其研究的重要性和研发难度。\n总结 数值方法水文模型发展历史并不长，但其更进一步探索自然水循环过程，因而引起了科学和工业界的重视。借助近年工程数学和计算技术的进步，数值方法水文模型的研究越来越多，并展现出其显著优势。 地表地下集成耦合模型结合水文、数学、工程和计算机领域最新发展，因而研发工作的人才、经费和时间投入巨大，一定程度阻碍了数值方法水文模型快速发展。\n与此同时，我国学界对于数值方法水文模型的探讨、开发和应用都非常薄弱，因此亟需在此领域的原创性、基础性探索；在支持新模型研发的同时，加强已有模型在全球的验证、推广和改进研究，不仅实践中给科学研究和工程应用提供支撑，也能够改进和提升对自然水循环的理解。\n中国科研面临“缺芯少软”局面，不仅制约我国科学研究前进步伐，也给未来发展埋下隐患。与国外研究比，我国在地表地下集成数值方法水文模型的开发、测试和应用方面研究都较为薄弱，受制于代码开源、数据制备、全球适应性验证等限制，国产模型工作尚未展示出足够科学影响力。因此，我国科学界亟需数值方法水文模型方向的开放性平台和原创性贡献。\n","date":1599185594,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659657600,"objectID":"d4de700c7f681d35fafb1202209e92b0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/project0/2020hundredstalents/","publishdate":"2020-09-03T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/en/project0/2020hundredstalents/","section":"project0","summary":"介绍 数值方法水文模型可视为一类特殊的分布式水文模型，典型特征","tags":["水文模型","数值方法","非结构三角形","地表-地下水耦合","有限体积法","C/C++"],"title":"数值方法分布式水文模型研发(中国科学院率先行动引才计划)","type":"project0"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The SHUD model description paper is published on the Geoscientific Model Development.\nTotal readers is more than 300 after the preprint.

However, significant difficulties remain for the development of efficient and extensible modeling systems that operate robustly across complex regions. This paper introduces the Simulator for Hydrologic Unstructured Domains (SHUD), an integrated, multiprocess, multiscale, flexible-time-step model, in which hydrologic processes are fully coupled using the finite volume method. SHUD integrates overland flow, snow accumulation/melt, evapotranspiration, subsurface flow, groundwater flow, and river routing, thus allowing physical processes in general watersheds to be realistically captured. SHUD incorporates one-dimensional unsaturated flow, two-dimensional groundwater flow, and a fully connected river channel network with hillslopes supporting overland flow and baseflow.\nThe paper introduces the design of SHUD, from the conceptual and mathematical description of hydrologic processes in a watershed to the model’s computational structures. To demonstrate and validate the model performance, we employ three hydrologic experiments: the V-catchment experiment, Vauclin’s experiment, and a model study of the Cache Creek Watershed in northern California. Ongoing applications of the SHUD model include hydrologic analyses of hillslope to regional scales (1 m2 to 106 km2), water resource and stormwater management, and interdisciplinary research for questions in limnology, agriculture, geochemistry, geomorphology, water quality, ecology, climate and land-use change. The strength of SHUD is its flexibility as a scientific and resource evaluation tool where modeling and simulation are required.\nHow to cite. Shu, L., Ullrich, P. A., and Duffy, C.

Spatial Data Annual Precipitation Sacramento Watershed The Sacramento River flows from Southern Oregon and to San Francisco Bay. Total drainage area is ~72000 km2. Elevation ranges from 0 to 4200m. The climate in SW is semi-arid hot Mediterranean. The spatial climatic characteristics are not only affected by latitude, terrain and snow coverage, but also by wind and ocean currents. Dramatic seasonal and annual climatic variations exist as well as large spatial heterogeneity. The mountains on the eastern and northern edges of the domain accumulate rain and snow which funnels into the groundwater of the whole watershed. Annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm/year to 1500 mm/year, however extreme annual precipitation was more than 4000 mm/year in Northern mountainous area in 1983, and mean precipitation was only 270 mm/year from the 2013 extreme drought year.\nAnimation of spatial annual precipitation in Sacramento Watershed Monthly variation of precipitation in Sacramento Watershed Annual precipitation variation from 1979 to 2017 based on NLDAS data Simulation and Results The calibration of the PIHM model used the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (Hansen 2006,Auger 2005). The automatic CMA-ES calibration is robust and able to converge to global optimization with low computing cost.\nRiver discharge The stream flow in the watershed follows the seasonal variation of precipitation. During drought years, the base flow from groundwater depletion contributes to the streamflow, and the excess infiltration replenishes ground water in wet seasons. For small watersheds in the Central Valley, such as catchment #9 where precipitation is less and the aquifer is thicker, the contribution from groundwater is small.\nCalibration based on discharge of four subcatchments Ground water variation The ground water near the river channel is shallower than the hill-slope. The spatial distribution pattern of ground water is controlled by topography, soil/geology characteristics and shape of the watershed. Steep slopes store less ground water than moderate slopes, because a steep hydraulic gradient on steep slopes drive the lateral groundwater flow.\nGround water spatial distribution Temporal fluctuation from 2000 to 2017. Ground water seasonal fluctuation follows the climatic variation. However, the seasonal variations in some catchments are relatively larger than others. The inter-annual variation in #5 sub-catchment is larger than seasonal variation. Although the annual precipitation trends in each sub-catchments are comparable, the trend in multiple-year changes of ground water table varies. This requires further analysis on water balance and the memory effect of ground water storage.\n","date":1550956394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572912e3,"objectID":"25de6c72de5b318c86753fcc9ad843fc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/project0/2019hyperion/","publishdate":"2019-02-23T21:13:14Z","relpermalink":"/en/project0/2019hyperion/","section":"project0","summary":"Introduction of HYPERION The objective of HYPERION is the development of a comprehensive regional hydroclimate data assessment capability focused on feature-specific metrics and stakeholder-relevant outcomes.

Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual-empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.

One is the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), a hydrologic model that partitions the water balance in space and time over the urban catchment. The other is the Cellular Automata Land Use Change Model (CALUC), a land use change model, which simulates the evolution of land use classes based on physical measures associated with population change and land use demand factors. We selected two study sites, one modern and one ancient, to highlight the capability of coupling catchment hydrology with land use change models. The goal is to assess the role of hydrologic change in urbanizing watersheds and to evaluate the contemporaneous impacts of climate change. The modern sites are the Conestoga watershed and the Lancaster PA urban center; the historical site is the ancient Maya city of Tikal in Peten region of Guatemala. In each setting, the essential data was developed and the models were used to evaluate how urbanization and land use change gradually altered the entire water balance often in unexpected ways.

With such design, a physical process was implemented as a module, or component. A new model can be generated in an intuitive way by linking module icons together and establishing their relationships. Following an introduction to the overall architecture, the designs for module linkage and data transfer between modules are described in details. Using XML based meta-information, modules in either source codes or binary form can be utilized by the environment. As a demonstration, with the help of HIME, we replaced the evaporation module of TOPMODEL with the evapotranspiration module from the Noah land surface model which explicitly accounts for vegetation transpiration. This example showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the modeling environment on model integration.","tags":["Noah LSM","TOPMODEL","modeling","environment","the Heihe River Basin"],"title":"Integrated modeling environment and a preliminary application on the Heihe River Basin, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4e651b5c90a20461b4bb53df9837c29","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/course/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/course/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Course","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"665288c8761d48eb3366c37954243edc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/gallery/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/gallery/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gallery","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bb238c2d1697da0a6715e7e8c8299cef","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Gallery","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3bf44c81f2a197de01edde90bcd77783","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/team/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/team/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Team","type":"widget_page"}]
